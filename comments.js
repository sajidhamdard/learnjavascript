Comments in JavaScript are used to explain the code and make the program more readable for developers.
In programming, comments can also be used to prevent some code lines from being executed. This is useful when testing.
There are single-line comments (which comment out one line or a part of one line) and multi-line comments (which comment out a block of code).*/

//Single line comment
