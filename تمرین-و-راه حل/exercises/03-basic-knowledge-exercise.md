### Question 1

Create a variable "marks" and assign any number. If the marks are greater than 60, then print "Pass," else print "Fail."

### Question 2

Take two numbers and check if both numbers are odd or not. If they are both odd, then print "Odd," otherwise print "Even."

### Question 3

Take four variables, "a," "b," "c," and "d," and assign their values in the following way: a = b, b = c, c = d, d = a. Check the output.

### Question 4

Print the 2's table using the \*\* operator. Use any logic, but it should print the 2's table.

### Question 5

Check the output of the following expressions and validate your answers:

```
2+5*10-20**2
20/5*10+10
```

### Question 6

Take a number and check if the number is odd or not. If the number is odd, then print "Yes," else print "No."

### Question 7

Take a number and check if the number is divisible by 10 and 5. If it is divisible, then print "Yes," else print "No."

### Question 8

Take a number and check if multiplying the number by 20 makes it 100 or not. If it does, then print "Yes," else print "No."

### Question 9

Calculate your 10th percentage and print "Pass" or "Fail." If the marks are more than 70, then print "Pass," else print "Fail."

### Question 10

Take your age and check if your age is greater than 21. If it is, print "Adult," else print "Minor."

### Question 11

Convert a if-else solution to ternary operator solution. So, instead of using if-else, use the ternary operator.

### Question 12

Implement mark-sheet logic

```
Take a field "percentage"
If percentage is >= 80 then print "Distinction"
If percentage is >= 60 and < 80 then print "First division"
If percentage >= 33 and < 60 then print "Second division"
if percentage < 33 then print "Fail"
```

### Question 13

Write a logic to find the maximum of 2 numbers

### Question 14

Write a logic to find maximum of 3 numbers
