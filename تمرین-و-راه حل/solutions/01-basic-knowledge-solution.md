### What is Programming Language?

   A programming language is a set of instructions, symbols and syntax that are used to create a software program or application. The code written in a programming language is then translated into machine code which can be executed by a computer.

   Programming languages have different features and capabilities, and are used to create different types of software. For example, C++ and C# are commonly used to create desktop and mobile applications, while Python and R are commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing.

   There are many different programming languages, each with their own syntax, libraries, and tools. Some popular programming languages include:

   - C++ and C#
   - Java
   - Python
   - JavaScript
   - Ruby
   - PHP
   - Swift
   - Go

   In short, a programming language is a set of instructions and symbols used to create software, it is the way of communicating with the computer, and there are many different types of programming languages available, each with its own strengths and uses.

### Tell about machine language?

   Machine language, also known as machine code or assembly language, is the lowest-level programming language that is understood directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It consists of a series of binary digits (ones and zeroes) that the CPU reads and executes as instructions. Machine language instructions are specific to a particular type of computer architecture and are not portable across different types of CPUs.

   Each machine language instruction corresponds to a specific operation that the CPU can perform, such as moving data from memory to a register, performing arithmetic operations, or jumping to a different location in the program.

   Machine language is often considered to be difficult to work with, as it is hard to read and understand. It is also not very human-readable, because it is not easy to understand the meaning of the instructions just by looking at the binary code. Therefore, it is not used to write software directly, but it is used as the final output of a compiler, interpreter or assembler.

   In summary, Machine language is the native language of the computer, it is the lowest-level programming language, it is not portable across different architectures, and it is not human-readable. It is used as the final output of a compiler, interpreter or assembler.

### Why different programming languages are used for coding?

   Different programming languages are used for coding because each language has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, and is better suited to certain types of tasks. Some of the reasons why different programming languages are used for different types of coding include:

   - Syntax: Different programming languages have different syntax, which can make the code more readable or easier to write for certain types of tasks. For example, Python's simple and readable syntax makes it a popular choice for beginners and for tasks related to data science.

   - Libraries and frameworks: Each programming language has its own set of libraries and frameworks that provide pre-built functionality for common tasks. For example, the Python ecosystem has a large number of libraries for data analysis and machine learning, while JavaScript has a wide range of libraries and frameworks for building web applications.

   - Platform and device support: Different programming languages have different levels of support for different platforms and devices. For example, C++ is often used to create desktop and mobile applications because it has good support for low-level hardware operations, while JavaScript is commonly used for web development because it can run on any web browser.

   - Performance: Different programming languages have different performance characteristics. For example, C++ and C are considered to be very fast and efficient languages, making them suitable for tasks that require a lot of computational power, such as video games and 3D rendering.

   - Community: Each programming language has its own community of developers and users. Larger and more active communities generally provide better support, documentation, and resources for learning and working with a language.

   In summary, Different programming languages are used for different types of coding because each language has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, depending on the task, such as syntax, libraries and frameworks, platform and device support, performance, and community.

### Tell about front-end and back-end languages?

Front-end and back-end languages refer to the different types of programming languages used in web development.

Front-end languages, also known as client-side languages, are used to create the user interface and user experience of a website. These languages are executed by the web browser on the user's computer and include:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): used to create the structure and layout of a website.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): used to control the visual presentation of a website.
- JavaScript: used to create interactive and dynamic elements on a website, such as form validation, image sliders, and interactive maps.

Back-end languages, also known as server-side languages, are used to create the logic and functionality of a website. These languages are executed on the web server and include:

###  What is HTML?

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. HTML uses a series of tags and attributes to define the structure and layout of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. It is a markup language, which means that it uses tags to describe the structure of the document, rather than describing its appearance.

### What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language used to describe the presentation and layout of a document written in a markup language, such as HTML. CSS allows developers to separate the presentation of a website from its structure, making it easier to maintain and update. With CSS, you can control things like font size and color, background images, spacing, and more. It is commonly used to style and layout web pages written in HTML, but can also be used with other markup languages like XML.

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity and other dynamic features to websites. It is primarily used to create things like image sliders, responsive navigation, form validation, and other dynamic user interface elements. JavaScript can also be used to make a website more interactive by allowing users to perform actions on the page such as clicking on buttons, submitting forms, and more. JavaScript code can be run directly within the browser, which means that it can update and change the content of a web page without the need to refresh the entire page.
It is a client-side scripting language, which means that it runs on the user's device rather than on a server.

### What is role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript?

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all used in the creation of modern websites, and each plays a distinct role in the development process:

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure the content of a website. It defines the elements on a page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links, and is used to create the basic structure of a webpage.

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the visual presentation of a website. It allows developers to separate the presentation of a website from its structure, making it easier to maintain and update. With CSS, you can control things like font size and color, background images, spacing, and more.

- JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity and other dynamic features to websites. It is primarily used to create things like image sliders, responsive navigation, form validation, and other dynamic user interface elements.

### Please tell about the history of JavaScript?

JavaScript was created in the mid-1990s by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation. The language was initially called Mocha, then changed to LiveScript, and finally, in December 1995, it was officially named JavaScript. The original purpose of JavaScript was to provide a way to make web pages more interactive by allowing them to respond to user input without requiring a page refresh.

JavaScript was first introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. The language quickly gained popularity, and it was later standardized by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) as ECMAScript. The first version of the ECMAScript standard was released in 1997.

Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with new features and capabilities being added with each new version of the ECMAScript standard. In recent years, JavaScript has also been used for server-side programming and mobile app development, thanks to technologies such as Node.js and React Native.

Today, JavaScript is one of the most widely-used programming languages in the world, and it is supported by all major web browsers. It is also used to create a wide range of applications, including web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, and more.

### Who invented JavaScript?

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape Communications Corporation in the mid-1990s. He created the language in just 10 days in May 1995. The original name of JavaScript was Mocha, later it was changed to LiveScript, and finally in December 1995, it was officially named JavaScript. The main purpose of the language was to provide interactive features to the web pages, so that it could respond to the user input without requiring a page refresh. The first version of JavaScript was introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 browser in September 1995.

### What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is a standardized version of the JavaScript programming language. It is a specification for the scripting language and is maintained by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA). The first version of ECMAScript was released in 1997, and it has since been updated several times to include new features and capabilities.

ECMAScript is essentially a set of rules and guidelines that define how JavaScript should be implemented and function. These guidelines include rules for syntax, data types, keywords, and other elements of the language. By standardizing the language in this way, ECMAScript ensures that JavaScript code will run consistently across different web browsers and platforms.

The latest version of ECMAScript is ECMAScript 2020 (ES2020). It was released on June 2020. It includes features such as globalThis, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, dynamic imports, and more.

ECMAScript's new versions are released annually, which is commonly known as "ECMAScript year-number" like ECMAScript 2019, ECMAScript 2020 and so on.

### What are the famous JavaScript versions and why?

There are several versions of JavaScript that are considered to be particularly significant or "famous" in the history of the language. These include:

- ECMAScript 1 (1997): The first version of the ECMAScript standard, which set the foundation for the modern JavaScript language.

- ECMAScript 3 (1999): The first widely-adopted version of JavaScript, which introduced many important features such as regular expressions and try-catch exception handling.

- ECMAScript 5 (2009): This version introduced several new features such as JSON support, strict mode, and improved support for working with arrays and objects.

- ECMAScript 6 (2015) : Also known as ECMAScript 2015, this version introduced several new features such as arrow functions, template literals, and let and const keywords. It also introduced new data types such as Map, Set and Symbol.

- ECMAScript 2016(ES7): This version introduced new features such as Array.prototype.includes, Exponentiation Operator, and Async/await

- ECMAScript 2017(ES8): This version introduced new features such as Shared Memory and Atomics, Object.values(), Object.entries(), and String padding

- ECMAScript 2018(ES9): This version introduced new features such as Asynchronous Iteration,Rest/Spread Properties, and finally

- ECMAScript 2020(ES10): This version introduced new features such as globalThis, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, dynamic imports, and more.

These versions of JavaScript were considered "famous" because they introduced new features and capabilities that had a significant impact on the way JavaScript is used and how developers work with the language. These features have changed the way web development is done and made the process more efficient and effective.

### How to use JavaScript in front-end and back-end?

JavaScript can be used both in the front-end and back-end of web development.

#### Front-end:

In front-end development, JavaScript is primarily used to create interactive user interfaces and dynamic web pages. This is done by adding JavaScript code to an HTML document and using it to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. This allows developers to create things like image sliders, responsive navigation, form validation, and other dynamic user interface elements. JavaScript code can be run directly within a web browser, which allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages without the need for constant page refreshes.

#### Back-end:

JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming, thanks to technologies such as Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that allows developers to run JavaScript code on a server. Node.js provides an environment for JavaScript to run on a server, which enables developers to use JavaScript for back-end development. This allows developers to create back-end services, such as APIs, and to create real-time web applications. With the help of Node.js, developers can use the same language for both client-side and server-side, which makes development more consistent and efficient.

In short, JavaScript can be used in the front-end to create interactive user interfaces, and in the back-end to create server-side applications, APIs, and more. The versatility of JavaScript makes it a powerful tool for full-stack web development.

### What is web-browser?

A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and view web pages on the internet. It interprets the code of a webpage, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and renders it into a format that can be viewed and interacted with by users. Common examples of web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Opera.

Web browsers can be used to access a wide variety of web-based content, such as text, images, videos, and interactive applications. They also include features such as bookmarks, history, and extensions, which allow users to save and organize their favorite websites and add additional functionality to their browser.

Web-browsers also include developer tools which can be used by developers to debug and inspect the web pages, and to test the compatibility of the web pages across different browsers.

Web-browsers are an essential component of the internet and have made it possible for users to easily access and interact with a wide variety of online content.

### What is website?

A website is a collection of web pages that are organized and hosted on a web server. Websites can be accessed via a web browser by entering a domain name or IP address into the address bar. Websites can include text, images, videos, interactive elements, and other types of digital content. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as providing information, selling products or services, or facilitating communication and collaboration.

A website is typically made up of a number of different web pages that are linked together. The main page of a website is called the home page, and it is the first page that is displayed when a user visits the website. Websites can be designed and developed using a variety of languages and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they can be hosted on a variety of web servers.

Websites can be static, which means that the content of the website does not change, or dynamic, where the content of the website changes based on user input or other interactions. Websites can be simple with few pages or complex with hundreds or even thousands of pages.

In short, a website is a collection of web pages that can be accessed via a web browser, hosted on a web server and can be used for various purposes like providing information, selling products or services, or facilitating communication and collaboration.

### What is web page?

web browser. It is a document that is written in a markup language, such as HTML or XML, and can include text, images, videos, interactive elements, and other types of digital content.

Web pages are typically accessed by typing a URL, or web address, into the address bar of a web browser. Once a web page is accessed, the web browser will interpret the code of the page and render it into a format that can be viewed and interacted with by users.

Web pages are typically organized into websites, which are collections of related web pages that are linked together. Websites can include a home page, which is the main page of the website and the first page that is displayed when a user visits the website, as well as other pages such as about pages, contact pages, product pages, and more.

Web pages can be designed and developed using a variety of languages and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They can be simple with few elements or complex with many elements like images, videos, forms and interactive elements.

In short, a web page is an individual document that can be accessed via a web browser and contains different types of digital content like text, images, videos, interactive elements and more. It is a part of a website and is linked to other web pages within the website.
