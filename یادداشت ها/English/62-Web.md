### How the web works ?

JavaScript is primarily used in web development to make interactive and dynamic websites. It works by executing code directly within a user's browser, allowing the website to respond to user actions without having to send requests back to the server.

When a user visits a website, the browser sends a request to the server for the HTML file that contains the content of the page. The server responds with the HTML file, which the browser then parses, rendering the page's content.

JavaScript can then be used to modify the content of the page, add interactivity, and interact with APIs and other web services. JavaScript can also manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of the webpage, allowing developers to dynamically modify the layout and content of the site.

Overall, JavaScript plays a crucial role in making the web more interactive, responsive, and engaging for users.

### Server
A server is a computer program or a physical computer that provides resources or services to other computers or devices on a network. These resources can include files, applications, data storage, processing power, and network connectivity. Servers can be used in a variety of settings, including businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and even homes. They play a critical role in allowing multiple users to access shared resources and collaborate on tasks over a network. Examples of common server types include web servers, file servers, email servers, and database servers.

### Client
A client refers to a computer program or device that requests services, information or resources from another computer program or device, often called a server. In the context of computer networking, a client can be a web browser, email client, file transfer protocol (FTP) client or any other software that communicates with a server over a network to fulfill a particular purpose. Clients typically provide an interface for users to interact with a service or resource offered by a server, and they send requests and receive responses through a communication protocol such as HTTP, FTP, or SMTP.

### Request
A request is a message sent by a client to a server in order to ask the server to perform an action or provide some information. In the context of web development, a request typically refers to an HTTP request, which is a type of request made over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). An HTTP request consists of a method (such as GET or POST), a URL, headers, and optionally a body containing data to be sent to the server. The server responds to the request with an HTTP response, which may contain the requested information or an error message. Requests are a fundamental part of how clients and servers communicate over the internet.

### Response
Response refers to an answer or reaction given in reply to a certain stimulus or situation. It could be a verbal, nonverbal, or behavioral reaction to a question, request, action, or event. Responses can vary in nature, such as positive or negative, constructive or destructive, emotional or rational, depending on the context and individual's perception and interpretation of the stimulus. In communication or psychology, understanding and analyzing responses is crucial for effective understanding, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
