### Bundling With Parcel and NPM Scripts

To bundle your JavaScript code with Parcel and NPM Scripts, follow these steps:

1. Install Parcel as a dev dependency by running `npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev`.
2. Create an entry point file for your application (e.g. `index.js`).
3. Add a build script to your `package.json` file that runs Parcel on your entry point file. For example: `"build": "parcel build index.js"`.
4. Run the build script using NPM by running `npm run build`.

When you run the build script, Parcel will analyze your code and create a bundled version of it in a `dist` directory. The bundled file is optimized for production use and can be added to your HTML file like any other JavaScript file.

You can also customize your build process further by using options and plugins provided by Parcel. Check out the official documentation for more information.
