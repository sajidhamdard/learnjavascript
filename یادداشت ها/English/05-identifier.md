# Identifiers

### Identifiers

In JavaScript, an identifier is a name given to a variable, function, or other elements in a program. Identifiers are used to reference the elements they represent and are used throughout the program to access and manipulate data.

An identifier must start with a letter, underscore(\_), or dollar sign($) and can be followed by any number of letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

### Rules for creating identifiers

JavaScript has a set of rules for naming variables and other elements known as naming conventions. Some of the common naming conventions are:

- Variables and function should start with lowercase letters
- Constants should be in uppercase
- Avoid using reserved words as identifier names
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use snake_case for constants

For example, the following code defines a variable called myVariable:

- for example:

```javascript
let myVariable = 10; //myVariable is an identifer
```

```javascript
sum is an identifier here
function sum(a, b) {
console.log(a + b);
}
```

In this example, myVariable is the identifier for the variable.

JavaScript's Identifiers are a key aspect of the language, and are used extensively in web development to create dynamic and interactive web pages and for building web and mobile apps.

- Invalid Identifier examples

```javascript
let 12x = 10;
let &value = 10;
```

- Valid Identifier examples

```javascript
let x12 = 10;
let _value = 20;
let $_value = 100;
```
