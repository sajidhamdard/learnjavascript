### Building a Simple Promise
To create a simple Promise in JavaScript, you can use the following syntax:

```
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Do some asynchronous operation here
  // If successful, call resolve()
  // If there's an error, call reject()
});
```

You can replace the comments with actual code that performs an asynchronous operation, such as making an HTTP request or reading a file. Within the Promise constructor function, you can call the `resolve()` method to indicate that the operation was successful and pass any data you want to return. Alternatively, you can call the `reject()` method to indicate that an error occurred and pass an error message or object. 

Once you've created a Promise, you can use methods like `then()` and `catch()` to handle the results of the operation. For example:

```
myPromise.then(data => {
  // Handle successful result here
}).catch(error => {
  // Handle error here
});
```

The `then()` method takes a function that will be called if the Promise is resolved successfully, and the `catch()` method takes a function that will be called if the Promise is rejected.
