### Transpiling

Transpiling in JavaScript is the process of converting modern JavaScript code into an older version of JavaScript that can run in older browsers or environments. This is done by a transpiler, such as Babel, which reads the modern code and converts it into equivalent code that can run in older environments.

Here's an example of transpiling:

```javascript
// Modern JavaScript code using let and const
let myVar = 'Hello';
const myConst = 'World';

// Transpiled JavaScript code using var
var myVar = 'Hello';
var myConst = 'World';
```

In this example, we define two variables using the let and const keywords, which are features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). However, not all browsers support ES6, so we need to transpile our code to an older version of JavaScript that is widely supported.

After transpiling, the code is converted to use the var keyword, which is supported in all modern browsers and environments.

Another example of transpiling is using arrow functions:

```javascript
// Modern JavaScript code using arrow functions
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// Transpiled JavaScript code using function expressions
var add = function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

In this example, we define a simple function using the modern JavaScript arrow function syntax. However, not all browsers support this syntax, so we need to transpile our code using Babel or a similar tool.

After transpiling, the code is converted to use function expressions, which are supported in all modern browsers and environments.

Transpiling is a powerful technique that allows developers to use the latest features of JavaScript without worrying about browser compatibility issues. However, it's important to note that not all features of modern JavaScript can be transpiled, and some may require polyfills or other workarounds to work in older environments.
