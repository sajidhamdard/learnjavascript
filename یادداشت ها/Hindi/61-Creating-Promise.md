### what is Building a Simple Promise

Promises in JavaScript are used to handle asynchronous operations like fetching data from a database or making an API call. A Promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allows you to handle that result when it becomes available.

To build a simple Promise in JavaScript, you can use the Promise constructor function which takes a callback function with two arguments: resolve and reject. The resolve function is called when the Promise is fulfilled with a successful result, while the reject function is called when there's an error.

Here's an example of building a simple Promise which returns a message after a delay of 2 seconds:

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Hello World!");
  }, 2000);
});

myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // prints 'Hello World!' after 2 seconds
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In this example, we create a new Promise using the Promise constructor and pass in a callback function which uses the setTimeout function to delay the execution of the resolve function by 2 seconds. When the timeout is complete, the resolve function is called with the message 'Hello World!'.

We then chain the `.then()` method to the Promise object which will execute its callback function when the Promise is fulfilled successfully. The `console.log` statement inside the callback function prints the result of the Promise, which is the message 'Hello World!'.

If there was an error during the execution of the Promise, the `.catch()` method would be executed, which logs the error to the console with `console.error`.
